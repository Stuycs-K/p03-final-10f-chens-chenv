# Tic-Tac-Toe: Multiplayer Ranked!

### Our-Fantastic-Group-Name-TTT

Vincent Chen & Serena Chen

### Project Description:

This project seeks to implement tic-tac-toe using a ranked leaderboard and tracking game mechanics by using the following concepts:
- Allocating memory (refine)
- Working with files (refine)
- Signals
- Sockets

It's fun to play!

### Instructions:

The user compiles/runs this program by running make server in one terminal window, and running make client a positive number x of times, where x is greater than 2. From there, a subset will be matched into games with one another, where they'll be playing until one side wins or there is a draw.

The user interacts with this program by typing in a number from 1-9 inclusive to place a piece on the board. A player wins once they earn "three-in-a-row" before their opponent, at which point the game will end.
